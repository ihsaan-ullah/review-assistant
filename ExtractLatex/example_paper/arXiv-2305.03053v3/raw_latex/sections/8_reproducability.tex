\paragraph{Reproducibility Statement.}
To ensure reproducibility, we will release code for our algorithm, experiments, and baselines. We also include algorithm details in Section~\ref{sec:approach} and further in Appendix~\ref{ap:prop_rules}, experimental details in Section~\ref{sec:results} and Appendix~\ref{ap:data_usage}, and a proof of our Theorem~\hyperref[ap:TheoremDef]{1} in Appendix~\ref{ap:Theorem}.
