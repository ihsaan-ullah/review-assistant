      Abstract
    </h1>
    <p>
      Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various tasks, they still struggle with scenarios that involves complex reasoning and planning. Recent work proposed advanced prompting techniques and the necessity of fine-tuning with high-quality data to augment LLMs' reasoning abilities. However, these approaches are inherently constrained by data availability and quality. In light of this, self-correction and self-learning emerge as viable solutions, employing strategies that allow LLMs to refine their outputs and learn from self-assessed rewards. Yet, the efficacy of LLMs in self-refining its response, particularly in complex reasoning and planning task, remains dubious. In this paper, we introduce \model{} for the self-improvements of LLMs, which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with LLMs to establish a self-improving loop, thereby enhancing the capabilities of LLMs without additional annotations. Drawing inspiration from the success of AlphaGo, \model{} addresses the unique challenges of combining MCTS with LLM for self-improvement, including data scarcity, the vastness search spaces of language tasks, and the subjective nature of feedback in language tasks. \model{} is comprised of prompt synthesis component, an efficient MCTS approach tailored for language tasks, and a trio of critic models for precise feedback. Our experimental results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that \model{} significantly enhances the performance of LLMs without additional annotations, showing the potential for self-improvement in LLMs.

      \label{sec:intro} LLMs, trained on trillions of tokens with billions of parameters have shown unparalleled capabilities in a wide range of natural language processing tasks <a href="#touvron-2023">touvron-2023</a>, <a href="#team-2023">team-2023</a>, <a href="#openai-2023">openai-2023</a>. Nevertheless, they continue to face challenges in scenarios requiring complex reasoning and strategic planning <a href="#valmeekam-2022">valmeekam-2022</a>, <a href="#stechly-2024">stechly-2024</a>. While advanced prompting approaches such as Chain, Tree, Graph-of-Thought <a href="#wei-2022">wei-2022</a>, <a href="#yao-2024">yao-2024</a>, <a href="#besta-2024">besta-2024</a>, <a href="#ding-2023">ding-2023</a>, which generate intermediate steps in the reasoning process demonstrate large improvements on reasoning capability of LLMs, it remains essential to fine-tune LLMs using a substantial volume of high-quality, supervised data to fundamentally improve the model performance <a href="#nye-2021">nye-2021</a>, <a href="#lewkowycz-2022">lewkowycz-2022</a>, <a href="#chung-2022">chung-2022</a>. This methodology is inherently limited by the scope and quality of data that humans can provide. Considering existing challenges, the concept of self-correction and self-learning have been proposed as promising solutions <a href="#madaan-2024">madaan-2024</a>, <a href="#saunders-2022">saunders-2022</a>, <a href="#chen-2024">chen-2024</a>. Within these framework, LLMs typically operate by employing two main strategies: 1) they continuously refine their responses based on the feedback of their past responses, and 2) they extensively sample responses then learn from preferences judged by itself as reward models with PPO or DPO <a href="#yuan-2024">yuan-2024</a>, <a href="#yuan-2024">yuan-2024</a>, <a href="#chen-2024">chen-2024</a>. However, it remains a matter of ongoing research whether LLMs can effectively critique their own outputs to either enhance response quality or apply a scalar reward to indicate the quality of responses, especially in contexts demanding intricate planning and reasoning <a href="#valmeekam-2022">valmeekam-2022</a>, <a href="#stechly-2024">stechly-2024</a>, <a href="#huang-2023">huang-2023</a>, <a href="#hong-2023">hong-2023</a>. On the other hand, advanced search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), combined with reinforcement learning, have enabled models to learn from self-play and achieve human parity or even surpass human performance in complex tasks such as the game of Go <a href="#silver-2016">silver-2016</a>, <a href="#silver-2017">silver-2017</a>. This naturally raises a question: is it viable to leverage the strengths of MCTS alongside LLMs to inaugurate a novel paradigm of self-improving? More precisely, could the assimilation of MCTS empower LLMs to more effectively explore better responses, guided by strategic signals, and subsequently optimize these responses to enhance overall performance? To answer this question, we begin with a systematic examination of AlphaGo, identifying three critical aspects for its success: ($\RN{1}$) The large volume of expert and self-play data; imitation learning on expert data enables it to simulate human-like strategies, and the reinforcement learning on self-play data fosters the emergence of novel tactics that surpass human capabilities <a href="#clark-2015">clark-2015</a>. ($\RN{2}$) The use of tree search, which facilitates the exploration of potential moves through statistical sampling of the large search space. This approach allows AlphaGo to effectively identify and simulate the most promising strategies, thereby making highly informed decisions in the complex and vast decision space <a href="#silver-2016">silver-2016</a>. ($\RN{3}$) Accurate and unambiguous environment feedback; the direct and accurate feedback (win or loss) provided by the game of Go offers a clear and unequivocal learning signal <a href="#silver-2017">silver-2017</a>. The integration of MCTS with LLMs for self-improvement has several challenges: ($\RN{1}$) Limited Data: High-quality annotated data for LLMs is generally scarce. Furthermore, how to construct of synthetic data for LLMs training, similar to AlphaGo's self-play data, remains unclear. ($\RN{2}$) Search Efficiency: The vast number of potential token combinations in natural language tasks results in an exponentially large search space, posing a significant challenge to the efficiency of MCTS <a href="#Ramamurthy2022IsRL">Ramamurthy2022IsRL</a>. ($\RN{3}$) Imperfect Feedback: In contrast to the clear win/loss feedback in Go, feedback in natural language tasks is often subjective and nuanced, without a straightforward measure of success.

      Figure <a href="#framework_crop">framework_crop</a>: Imagination-Searching-Criticizing self-improvement loop: Imagination component synthesizes prompts as new learning examples, with MCTS searching better trajectories guided by signals from critics for policy improving.
      <br/><br/>
      In this paper, we introduce \model{}, an imagination-searching-criticizing framework designed for the self-improvement of LLMs . \model{} consists of three key components, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#framework_crop">framework_crop</a>. First, an imagination component is designed to synthesize prompts, alleviating the issues of data scarcity. Second, we propose <em>eMCTS</em> tailored for efficient searching in language tasks. Particularly, it has been show that planning at multiple levels of temporal abstraction is critical for RL problems with a long horizon and large action space <a href="#sutton-1999">sutton-1999</a>, <a href="#peng-2017">peng-2017</a>, <a href="#Luketina2019ASO">Luketina2019ASO</a>. As such, we propose formulating the text generation process as options over a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem, where each option represents the generation of a collection of tokens for a specific subtask, similar to the concept of chains in chain-of-thought prompting. This formulation improves search efficiency by substantially reducing the search depth. Additionally, we propose the use of state fusion and adaptive branching factors to further enhance search efficiency by balancing the trade-off between search width and depth. Lastly, since accurate feedback is crucial to the success of MCTS, we introduce a trio of critic models to guide eMCTS, including a value function for estimating future rewards, a process reward model for assessing node correctness, and an outcome reward model for evaluating the overall trajectory. For complex tasks with which LLMs struggle assessing such as arithmetic computation and code execution, to ensure the accuracy of feedback, we augment the critics with the capacity to make dynamic decisions on which tools to use, when to use them, and how to use them effectively. After eMCTS stage, we collect the trajectory with the largest reward from the critic models as the training examples to improve LLMs. The experimental results on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that \model{} can efficiently search for better responses and use them to improve LLMs' performance, forming an effective self-improving loop. Notably, based on LLaMA-2 70b, \model{} can improve its performance from 57.8 to 92.0 on GSM8K and from 20.7 to 51.0 on MATH, performing comparably to GPT-4. In summary, our contributions are threefold:
      <br/><br/>
      &bull; We examine the inherent challenges in harnessing AlphaGo's self-learning algorithms for LLMs, which are data scarcity, the complexity of search spaces, and the nuanced nature of feedback.
      <br/>
      &bull; We introduce \model{}, an imagination-searching-criticizing framework that integrates MCTS with LLMs, enabling them to self-improve without the need for additional annotations.
      <br/>
      &bull; Experiments on mathematical reasoning problems show that, by employing \model{}, we can significantly enhance the performance of LLaMA-2 70B, elevating it to levels comparable with GPT-4 on the GSM8K and MATH datasets when eMCTS decoding is utilized.

      <strong>LLM Self-improving</strong> Being a key to the success of scalable oversight <a href="#bowman-2022">bowman-2022</a>, self-improving for LLM aims to align the LLM to human preference and values mainly using the supervision from the knowledge inside the LLM. One crucial part of self-improving is how to obtain reliable signal of critique to distinguish between good responses from the LLM and bad ones. Initial work <a href="#bai-2022">bai-2022</a>, <a href="#wang-2022">wang-2022</a> first asks the LLM to generate input queries of diverse tasks and the corresponding outputs. They then rely on hand-crafted heuristic rules to filter out redundant or low-quality data pairs (e.g. the query is too long or too short). Since it is non-trivial to compose effective heuristic rule, later work <a href="#sun-2023">sun-2023</a>, <a href="#li-2023">li-2023</a>, <a href="#guo-2024">guo-2024</a> proposes a few general principles or judging criteria and ask the LLM itself to evaluate the quality its responses based on these guidance. They hope that the LLM can automatically designate these principles into each data point to better guide data filtering. However, this requires the LLM to have strong abilities to apply these principles for each specific case and make correct judgements. Different from previous work, we propose to leverage the supervision from MCTS for LLM self-improvement: taking the outputs of MCTS to continue train the LLM. This is because the outputs from MCTS are usually in much better quality then standard nucleus sampling, and the large gap ensure that the LLM can self improve. Another line of research explores cheaply available knowledge. Some <a href="#saunders-2022">saunders-2022</a>, <a href="#wang-2023shepherd">wang-2023shepherd</a> collects large-scale critique data from question-and-answer websites (e.g., stack exchange) for continue pretraining, while others <a href="#gou-2023">gou-2023</a> utilize external tools to provide more fine-grained guidance. The goal of both directions is to enhance critique ability of the LLM for self-improving. Our approach based on MCTS is intuitively orthogonal to this line of research.

      <strong>Preliminaries</strong> <br/>
      \label{sec:pre} 
      <em>Problem Formulation</em> In this paper, we consider a LLM characterized by probability $p_\theta$ and denoted as policy $\pi_\theta$. It takes a sequence $\vx =[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ as input, which is typically referred as prompt, to generate the response $\vy = [y_1, \cdots, y_m]$. The response $\vy$ can be viewed as samples from the conditional probability distribution $p_\theta(\cdot|\vx)$. In the context of LLMs, each $x_i$ and $y_i$ represents a token from a pre-defined vocabulary. The policy $\pi_\theta$ operates in an autoregressive manner, where each token is generated sequentially, relying solely on the context provided by the previously generated tokens. The policy therefore constitutes a Markov process in which the conditional probability distribution $p_\theta(\vy|\vx)$ can be decomposed and expressed with the chain rule: $p_\theta(\vy|\vx) = \prod_{i=1}^{m} p_{\theta}(y_i|\vx, \vy_{<i})$. With this property, the text generation task can be formulated as an Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem consisting of $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, T, R, \gamma)$ in which:
      <br/><br/>
      &bull; <strong>State</strong> $\vs_t \in \mathcal{S}$: Represents the context information of current trajectory, i.e. current status of the generation process, e.g. a partial response to a prompt. The initial state $s_0$ corresponds to the original prompt. <br/>
      &bull; <strong>Action</strong> $a_t \in \mathcal{A}$: Denotes a single action or sampled token from the vocabulary, leading to a transition to a new state $\vs_{t+1}$, by concatenating $\vs_t$ and $a_t$. <br/>
      &bull; <strong>Reward</strong> $r_t = R(\vs_t, a_t)$: Manifest the evaluation of the generation to the prompt, reflecting the desirability or preferences of each state-action pair, such as whether the actions follow instructions in the prompt. <br/><br/>
      Here, $\gamma$ denotes the discount factor, while $T$ signifies the transition probability function (omitted here as the transition is deterministic in text generation). This MDP framework sets the stage for applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to optimize the policy $\pi_\theta$ aiming to maximize the expected cumulative reward $R$. Based on these setups, we describe the self-improving problem. Given a LLM $\pi_\theta$ and an initial dataset $\mathcal{D}^0$, which consists of $N$ expert-generated prompt-response pairs $\{(\vx_i^0, \vy_i^0) \mid i \in [N]\}$, the goal of self-improving is to iteratively refine $\pi_\theta$ to maximize the reward. The refinement process includes learning from synthesized prompts and corresponding responses. These responses are obtained using an advanced search algorithm that navigates the space of possible responses to maximize the expected reward. The detailed process is described in Algorithm 1.

      <strong>Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)</strong> <br/>
      MCTS is a sampling-based search algorithm for policy optimization in decision-making problems. It iteratively builds a search tree by repeating four phases: selection, expansion, evaluation, and backpropagation. In the selection phase, it recursively selects the children from the root node by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) bandit, given by $UCB(i)=w_i+C*\sqrt{2*\ln{\frac{N_i}{n_i}}}$, where $n_i$ and $N_i$ are the visit counts for the node $i$ and its parent respectively, $C$ is a hyperparameter balancing exploration and exploitation, and $w_i$ is the average value of all descendant nodes of $i$. After selection, the tree undergoes expansion according to the defined policy. During evaluation, the value of the newly expanded node is estimated by sampling or model-based methods, and finally, in backpropagation, the estimated value is propagated to all ancestor nodes.
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>\model{}</strong> <br/>
      \label{sec:method} 
      <em>Overview</em> The architecture of \model{} is depicted in Figure <a href="#framework_crop">framework_crop</a>, comprising three key components. Firstly, the imagination component is tasked with synthesizing prompts as learning examples. Secondly, an efficient search component, named eMCTS, is proposed to search high-quality trajectories for optimizing the policy. Lastly, the search process is guided by critics specifically designed to provide reliable signals.
      <br/><br/>
      <em>Data Synthesizing</em> Let $\mathcal{D}^0 = \{(\vx_i, \vy_i) \mid i \in [N]\}$ denote the initial dataset of expert-generated prompt-response pairs. The data synthesizing process aims to expand this dataset by generating a set of synthesized prompts $\mathcal{D}^1 = \{(\vx_i^1,\cdots) \mid i \in [N]\}$. The generation of each synthesized prompt $\vx_i^1$ is described mathematically as a transformation $g$ applied to one or more examples from $\mathcal{D}^0$: 
      $$
      \vx_i^1 = g(\vx_{i_1}^0,\cdots,\vx_{i_m}^0, \pi^0)
      $$
      where $\vx_{i_1}^0,\cdots,\vx_{i_m}^0$ are selected examples from $\mathcal{D}^0$. The function $g$ may be a learnable function, heuristic rules, a strong LLM, or the policy model $\pi^0$ itself equipped with synthesis instructions. This process enriches the diversity and complexity for training the policy model. Among various strategies, such as Self-instruct <a href="#wang-2022">wang-2022</a>, Evol-instruct <a href="#xu2023wizardlm">xu2023wizardlm</a>, we opt for a method similar to that described in <a href="#yu-2023">yu-2023</a>.
      <br/><br/>
      <em>eMCTS</em> <br/>
      Instead of token-level or sentence-level search, we adopt option-level MCTS where each option represents a sequence of tokens (from multiple tokens to several sentences). Table <a href="#table-option">table-option</a> compares token-level, sentence-level, and option-level search nodes.
      <br/><br/>
      <em>Importance Weighted Expansion</em> Previous work often assumes a constant branching factor. Here, we dynamically adjust the branching factor based on the importance of each node. We define the importance of a state $\vs_t$ as:
      $$
      I(\vs_t) = \max_{\vo_t} |v^{\pi}([\vs_t,\vo_t])- v^{\pi}(\vs_t)|
      $$
      and set the allowed children number $n(\vs_t)$ as:
      $$
      n(\vs_t) = \max\left(c_{\mathtt{min}}(t), \min\left(\lfloor \alpha I(\vs_t) \rfloor, c_{\mathtt{max}}(t)\right)\right).
      $$
      <br/><br/>
      <em>State Merge</em> To maximize diversity among states under the same node, we partition available options into groups based on similarity. Each new option is compared via a heuristic (e.g. edit distance or model-based method) as outlined in Algorithm 2.
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Algorithm 2: Find Action with Minimum Distance Larger Than Threshold</strong>
      <br/>
      <em>Input</em>: max number of trials $max\_trials$, threshold $thres$ <br/>
      <em>Output</em>: pool of children nodes <br/>
      Set $n \gets 0$, $min\_dist \gets 0$ <br/>
      While $n < max\_trials$ and $min\_d \leq thres$: <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample $\vo_t \sim \pi(s_t)$ <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compute $min\_d \gets \min_{\vo \in A_{t, \mathtt{pool}}} \mathtt{Dist}(\vo_t, \vo)$ <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$n \gets n + 1$ <br/>
      Add $\vs_{t+1} = [\vs_t, \vo_t]$ to the pool of children nodes.
      <br/><br/>
      <em>Fast Rollout with Specialized LM</em> Since the policy $\pi_\theta$ is computationally heavy for rollouts, a smaller specialized LM, $\pi^{\mathtt{fast}}$, is used to perform fast simulations until termination.
      <br/><br/>
      <em>Critic</em> <br/>
      Three critic models guide the search process: the value function $v^\pi$, process reward model (PRM), and outcome reward model (ORM). <br/><br/>
      <strong>Value Function.</strong> The value function $v^\pi(\vs)$ estimates the expected future discounted reward from state $\vs$. It is trained by approximating $v^\pi_\phi(\vs) \approx \frac{1}{J} \sum_{j=1}^{J} G^{(j)}(\vs)$ and optimizing the mean squared error loss:
      $$
      \mathcal{L}_\phi = - \mathbb{E}_{(\vs, v)\sim \mathcal{D}_{\mathtt{value}}} \big(v_\phi^\pi(\vs) - v\big)^2.
      $$
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>PRM.</strong> To mitigate delayed credit assignment issues, PRM predicts an immediate textual reward $r_t^{\mathtt{PRM}}$ for taking an option $\vo_t$ in state $\vs_t$. It is trained with prompt templates that include the state, action, and assessment.
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>ORM.</strong> ORM evaluates entire trajectories to assess their alignment with the desired end goal. It is similarly formulated as a text generation task.
      <br/><br/>
      <em>Policy Self-Improvement</em> <br/>
      The self-improvement loop consists of data generation and policy finetuning. Training examples are collected by performing eMCTS on synthetic prompts and filtering high-quality trajectories via a quality evaluating function $f$. The prompt template for finetuning is:
      <br/><br/>
      <em>
      A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant.  
      The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.  
      User: $\vx_i$  
      Assistant: $\vy_i$
      </em>
      <br/><br/>
      The finetuning loss is given by:
      $$
      \mathcal{L}_{\theta_k} = \mathbb{E}_{(\vx^k_i, \vy^k_i) \sim \mathcal{D}_k} \big[\log \pi_{\theta_k}(\vy^k_i|\vx^k_i) \big].
      $$
      This results in an updated policy $\pi_{\theta_{k+1}}$. Other methods such as DPO or PPO are left for future work.

      LLaMA-2 70B is used as the policy model for GSM8K and WizardMath 70B V10 for MATH. For the critic models and fast rollout policy, Abel-002-7B is used. Detailed MCTS parameters (including constants $c$, $\alpha$, $c_\mathtt{min}(t)$, $c_\mathtt{max}(t)$, and termination conditions) are provided for each dataset. Policy self-improvement is conducted for up to 3 epochs with specific training hyperparameters, and for the second self-improvement round, 7.9k MetaMath prompts are sampled.

      <strong>Limitations and Future Work</strong>
      <br/>
      Despite the promising results of \model{}, several limitations warrant further exploration. (i) The current synthetic prompt generation employs relatively simple methods; future work should explore advanced techniques (e.g. Self-Instruct) to generate diverse and capability-aware prompts. (ii) Although \model{} shows improvements when decoded with eMCTS, its performance with greedy sampling remains substantially lower; further investigation is needed to fully leverage MCTS in the self-improvement loop. (iii) The critic models are static in the current framework. Future research should explore mechanisms for continual updates to better adapt to evolving policy models. (iv) The evaluation has been limited to mathematical reasoning tasks and should be extended to other domains.

      <strong>Conclusion</strong>
      <br/>
      \label{sec:con} In this paper, we introduce \model{}, an imagination-searching-criticizing framework for the self-improvement of LLMs without requiring additional annotations. Central to the approach is the integration of MCTS with LLMs. To address challenges such as data scarcity, the vast search space, and the subjective nature of feedback in language tasks, we propose a data synthesizer for prompt generation, an optimized MCTS for efficient search, and a trio of critic models that provide precise feedback. Experimental findings on mathematical reasoning tasks reveal that \model{} significantly improves LLM performance without extra annotations, and when decoded with eMCTS, performs comparably to GPT-4, highlighting its potential for self-improvement in complex problem-solving.
